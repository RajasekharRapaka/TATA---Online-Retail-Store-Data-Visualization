“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Tata's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it
was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a
consulting team at Tata.
I worked on a project to help a retail client review their revenue data to
prepare for the future. I created data visuals, practiced using Tableau and
PowerBI to represent information, and built my presentation skills in a
real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on strategic problems
for clients and I'm excited to apply these skills on a consulting team at a
company like Tata.
